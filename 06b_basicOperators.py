"""
mathematical calculations can be performed on variables
 basic operators in python include
 addition +,
 subtraction -,
 multiplication *,
 division /,
 floor division//,
 modulus% and
 exponent **
 """
a = 10
b = 5

# addition
plus = a + b

# subtraction
minus = a - b

# multiplication
multiply = a * b

# division
divide = a / b

# floor division
f_divide = a // b

# modulus
modi = a % b

# exponent (a to the power of b)
root = a ** b

''' 
other operators 
+=,
-=,
*=
lets look at the following example 
'''
a = a + 1
# this is the same as
a += 1
# += combines the assignment sign with the addition operator

print(plus, minus, multiply, divide, f_divide, modi)
